## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

### Temporal Learning Paradigm

TEMPO employs a **Transformer-based encoder** trained with multiple temporal objectives:

**1. Future State Prediction (Primary Objective)**  
Learn to predict behavioral states 2 seconds into the future from current context. This temporal 
prediction task serves as the main learning signal, forcing the model to capture attention-relevant 
dynamics without explicit frame-level labels.

**2. Behavioral Consistency Regularization**  
Encourage stable embeddings for similar attention patterns through consistency constraints on the 
learned representations.

**3. Cross-Modal Feature Alignment**  
Learn relationships between behavioral modalities (gaze ↔ expression ↔ engagement) by predicting 
one feature subset from another.

**4. Temporal Smoothness Regularization**  
Penalize abrupt transitions in the learned attention flow to encourage natural behavioral dynamics.

## 🔬 Multimodal Feature Engineering

The framework processes three progressively refined feature sets, demonstrating systematic 
feature selection from comprehensive extraction to psychologically-grounded optimization.

### Feature Evolution

## 🎓 Technical Deep Dive

### Training Objectives

The encoder is trained with a weighted combination of temporal learning objectives:
```
L_total = 2.0 × L_temporal + 0.5 × L_consistency + 
          0.4 × L_cross_modal + 0.3 × L_smoothness
```

**Temporal Prediction (Weight: 2.0)**
- Predict future behavioral states (50 frames ahead, ~2 seconds)
- Huber loss for robustness to outliers
- Primary learning signal - forces model to capture attention dynamics

**Behavioral Consistency (Weight: 0.5)**
- Regularization objective: similar attention patterns → similar embeddings
- MSE loss on embedding similarity vs. attention similarity matrices
- Encourages attention-relevant invariances in learned representations

**Cross-Modal Alignment (Weight: 0.4)**
- Predict engagement features from gaze/expression features
- MSE loss on cross-modal predictions
- Captures multimodal relationships without explicit fusion

**Temporal Smoothness (Weight: 0.3)**
- L1 penalty on temporal differences in learned attention flow
- Regularizes abrupt transitions
- Encourages natural behavioral dynamics

## 📊 Results & Evaluation

### Downstream Task: Attention Prediction

After pre-training with temporal objectives, the encoder was fine-tuned for attention prediction 
using video-level proxy scores derived via Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) from DAiSEE labels 
(Engagement, Boredom, Confusion, Frustration).

**Attention Proxy Score Formula:**
```
Attention = (E - 0.29×B - 0.17×C - 0.54×F) / 3
```
Weights derived from AHP prioritization matrices based on psychological attention literature.

**Performance Metrics (Test Set - 1,577 videos):**
```
Mean Squared Error (MSE):     0.0096
Root Mean Squared Error:      0.0981
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):    0.0791
Pearson Correlation:          0.2154 (p < 0.001)
```

### Interpretation

1. **Label Noise**: DAiSEE annotations have known inter-annotator variability (~0.6 agreement), 
   limiting the upper bound on correlation with proxy scores.

2. **Temporal Granularity**: 30-second windows may be too coarse for capturing local attention 
   shifts, which often occur at sub-5-second scales.

3. **Modality Limitations**: Webcam-observable facial features provide weaker signal than 
   eye-tracking or physiological measures. The correlation of 0.22 suggests facial cues capture 
   only partial aspects of attention.

4. **Representation Quality**: The learned embeddings capture temporal patterns (as evidenced 
   by convergent temporal prediction loss during pre-training), but these patterns may reflect 
   general behavioral dynamics rather than attention-specific features.

### Future Directions

Based on these results, promising directions include:
- **Multi-modal fusion**: Incorporating audio (speech patterns, silence) and screen interaction data
- **Hierarchical temporal modeling**: Learning at multiple timescales (1s, 5s, 30s windows)
- **Eye-tracking integration**: Fine-grained gaze data for stronger supervision signal
- **Contrastive pre-training**: Proper SimCLR/MoCo implementation with data augmentation strategies
- **Larger-scale pre-training**: More diverse behavioral data beyond online learning contexts
